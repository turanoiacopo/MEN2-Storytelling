This is what I know about myself: the entire front of my body from the neck down, and the back of my legs.<br /> When I feel hungry, I eat a ration of food.<br /> When I feel thirsty, I drink a ration of water.<br /> When I feel bored, I read one of the books on the shelf in my cell.<br /> When I am neither hungry nor thirsty nor bored, I do nothing.<br /> A thought unsettles me. Since I no longer know the fate of the human species, it would be unrealistic to rule out the possibility that I am the last human alive. For some reason, I feel the need to remember my past in order to preserve it for as long as possible.<br /> From now on, when I am neither hungry nor thirsty nor bored, I will try to remember who I am.",
