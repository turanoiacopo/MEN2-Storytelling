            Description:<br>
            This project consists of a series of short stories revolving around a single character trying to remember its identity. Each story is meant to reflect on different aspects of isolation and its influence on reality. In addition to the written narration, this project is meant to be a testing ground for different ways of narrating.<br>
            The project is still ongoing.
